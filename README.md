# Datasets
We have collected approximately one million patient-doctor conversations from online medical consultation platforms between 2022 and 2023. Each conversation includes a coarse-grained departmental label and a fine-grained pre-diagnosis disease tag. 

The raw texts and preprocessed data will be publicly available in the near future. If you want to use this dataset, please request my supervisor at qkpeng@xjtu.edu.cn.
