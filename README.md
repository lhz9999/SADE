# Datasets
We have collected approximately one million patient-doctor conversations from online medical consultation platforms between 2022 and 2023. Each conversation includes a coarse-grained departmental label and a fine-grained pre-diagnosis disease tag. As a result, we have created two datasets: the Triage Dataset, which contains 407,060 samples with 14 categories, and the Pre-diagnosis Dataset, which consists of 344,883 samples with 48 categories.
